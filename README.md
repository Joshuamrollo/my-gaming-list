This is a MERN stack project using JWT tokens for authentication and redux for state management. The backend is in the main folder and the frontend is in the client folder. The backend is being run on heroku and connects routes for MongoDB Atlas to requests from the frontend which was deployed using Netlify. The app is used as a place that consolidates video game reviews and ratings so users can compare games from different platforms in one place. Users can add game to their list and rate them then look at the top rated games on the main page. Users can also search for games using the search bar and they will appear in sorted order from highest rated to lowest rated.
